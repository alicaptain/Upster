A study to improve JS skills

This is a challenge given me one of the best mentor a programmer candidate could run into (not only this).
I had to be able to manipulate some pseudo elements which seems not possible without using CSS variables in ':root'.

The button increases the value inside red circle (pseudo: before) and also inflates the circle each time it's pressed.
